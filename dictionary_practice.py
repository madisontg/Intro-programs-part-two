# exercise 3: Keys are how you navigate a dictionary.
#             If you don't know what a thing is named, you can't possibly call it.


# exercise 4: kinda just mess around there's no real purpose
D = {"a":3,"x":7,"r":5}

for key,val in D.items():
    if key == "x":
        print(val)
    if val == 7:
        print(key)
